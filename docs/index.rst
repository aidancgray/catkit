Documentation for CATKIT, the Control and Automation for Testbeds Kit
=====================================================================

``catkit``  is a collection of ``python`` hardware controllers. This project started
from STScI's Makidon Optics Lab as an effort to separate the hardware controllers we use
for the HiCAT testbed and make something less specific to our experiments. 

.. note:: 
    A few things to keep in mind::

    Some of these controllers require fairly specific hardware installs on your machine
    before they run as expected. 

    This is still very much a work in progress. The hardware controllers don't all
    match in style or class inheritance. Use or contribute at your own risk.
